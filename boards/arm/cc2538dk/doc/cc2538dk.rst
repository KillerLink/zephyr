Supported Features
==================

Zephyr has been ported to the CC2538 MCU, with basic
peripheral driver support

+-----------+------------+-----------------------+
| Interface | Controller | Driver/Component      |
+-----------+------------+-----------------------+
| UART      | on-chip    | serial                |
+-----------+------------+-----------------------+
| GPIO      | on-chip    | gpio                  |
+-----------+------------+-----------------------+
| RF        | on-chip    | ???                   |
+-----------+------------+-----------------------+

Connections and IOs
===================

Peripherals on the CC2538DK are mapped to the following
pins (in the file boards/arm/cc2538_developmentkit/pinmux.c):

+----------------+-----+------+
| Function       | PIN | GPIO |
+----------------+-----+------+
| LED0           |     |      |
+----------------+-----+------+
| LED1           |     |      |
+----------------+-----+------+
| LED2           |     |      |
+----------------+-----+------+
| LED3           |     |      |
+----------------+-----+------+
| BUTTON0        |     |      |
+----------------+-----+------+
| BUTTON1        |     |      |
+----------------+-----+------+
| BUTTON2        |     |      |
+----------------+-----+------+
| BUTTON3        |     |      |
+----------------+-----+------+
| BUTTON4        |     |      |
+----------------+-----+------+

The default configuration can be found in the Kconfig file
at boards/arm/cc2538_developmentkit/cc2538_developmentkit_defconfig

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Build
=====

Follow the :ref:`getting_started` instructions for Zepyhr
application development.

To build for the CC2538 Development Kit:

.. code-block:: console

	% mkdir build
    % mkdir build/cc2538dk
	% cd build/cc2538dk
    % cmake ../.. -DBOARD=cc2538_developmentkit
    % make

This will produce both a zephyr.elf (for GDB debugging)
and a zephyr.bin file (for flashing) in the build/cc2538dk
subdirectory

FTDI USB Setup
==============

The CC2538 Development Kit has onboard USB-Serial 
capabilities provided by the XDS100v3 chip.

Under Linux, plugging in the device should result
in two new devices as /dev/ttyUSB[0-99]
It might be helpfull to check the output of the "dmesg"
command to find wheter or not the devices are present
and what their names are

It might be necessary to setup permissions as follows:
TODO: insert udev description

It might be necessary to setup the ftdi driver to be used:
TODO: insert ftdi driver description

If only reading from the Device is required the following
command sequence can be helpfull:
TODO: insert stty && cat command description

Debugging
=========
